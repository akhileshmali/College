Consider following Relation 
    Account(Acc_no, branch_name,balance)
    Branch(branch_name,branch_city,assets)
    Customer(cust_name,cust_street,cust_city)
    Depositor(cust_name,acc_no)
    Loan(loan_no,branch_name,amount)
    Borrower(cust_name,loan_no)
Create above tables with appropriate constraints like primary key, foreign key, not null etc.
    1. Find all customers who have both account and loan at bank.
    2. Find all customers who have an account or loan or both at bank.
    3. Find all customers who have account but no loan at the bank.
    4. Find average account balance at "Wadia College" branch.
    5. Find no. of depositors at each branch
