Consider following Relation 
    Employee(emp_id,employee_name,street,city)
    Works(employee_name,company_name,salary)
    Company(company_name,city)
    Manages(employee_name,manager_name)
Create above tables with appropriate constraints like primary key, foreign key, not null etc. 
1. Find the names of all employees who work for "TCS".
2. Find the names and company names of all employees sorted in ascending order of company name 
and descending order of employee names of that company.
3. Change the city of employee working with InfoSys to "Bangalore"
4. Find the names, street address, and cities of residence for all employees who work for 
'TechM' and earn more than $10,000.
5. Add Column Asset to Company table.
