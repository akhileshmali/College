Consider following Relation 
    Account(Acc_no, branch_name,balance)
    Branch(branch_name,branch_city,assets)
    Customer(cust_name,cust_street,cust_city)
    Depositor(cust_name,acc_no)
    Loan(loan_no,branch_name,amount)
    Borrower(cust_name,loan_no)
Create above tables with appropriate constraints like primary key, foreign key, not null etc.
    1. Find the names of all branches in loan relation.
    2. Find all loan numbers for loans made at "Wadia College" Branch with loan amount > 12000.
    3. Find all customers who have a loan from bank. Find their names,loan_no and loan amount.
    4. List all customers in alphabetical order who have loan from "Wadia College" branch.
    5. Display distinct cities of branch.
