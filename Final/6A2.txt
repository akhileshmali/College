Consider following Relation 
    Employee(emp_id,employee_name,street,city)
    Works(employee_name,company_name,salary)
    Company(company_name,city)
    Manages(employee_name,manager_name)
Create above tables with appropriate constraints like primary 
key, foreign key, not null etc. 
1. Change the city of employee working with InfoSys to "Bangalore"
2. Find the names of all employees who earn more than the average salary of all employees 
of their company. Assume that all people work for at most one company.
3. Find the names, street address, and cities of residence for all employees who work for 'TechM' 
and earn more than $10,000.
4. Change name of table Manages to Management.
5. Create Simple and Unique index on employee table.
6. Display index Information
